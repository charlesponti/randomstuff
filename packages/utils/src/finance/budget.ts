/**
 * Often called the 'One Number' Budget, this budgeting method is
 * based on the 50/30/20 rule. This rule states that 50% of your
 * income should go towards needs, 30% towards wants, and 20% towards
 * savings and debt repayment.
 *
 * This function calculates users' weekly flexible spending budget by
 * subtracting monthly fixed costs from monthly income and dividing the remainder by 4.3.
 * NOTE: 4.3 is used instead of 4 to account for months with 5 weeks.
 *
 * @param {number} monthlyIncome - The total sum of all income per month
 * @param {number} monthlyFixedCosts - The sum of all costs that are fixed
 * @return {number}
